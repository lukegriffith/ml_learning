Following the exercises implemented a perceptron network, replacing the sigmoid activation function with a step function. 

Exercise one proves that multiplying all the weights and biases in the network by a positive constant that the behaviour of the network doesn't change. Running the predict method on the same network after calling the enable constant method proves that the output weights of the network remain the same.
